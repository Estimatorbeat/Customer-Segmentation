## PROJECT - MACHINE LEARNING

In this project I have tried to demonstrate a customer segmentation model to help the retail company in developing targeted marketing strategies with the use of Machine Learning in businesses for profit enhancement

Unsupervised Learning(Clustering) is used to find the hidden data patterns or structures which can be used by an organiztion(like mall, shopping complexes etc) to target the right audience and hence increase profit margin.

Also, this approach allows the organizations to spend less on advertisements by first choosing the right audience and then advertising.


The dataset used has following details : The features in the dataset are explained below :

- Customer ID - It is the unique ID assigned to the customer
- Gender - Gender of the customer
- Age - Age of the customer(in years)
- Annual Income(k$) - Annual income of the customer in k$
- Spending Score - Score assigned to the customer by the retail company based on the customer spending nature and behaviour
